# game-theory-homework
In this repository, there is a game theory homework assignment and its solution that I created while serving as a teaching assistant for the Game Theory course instructed by Dr. Fazli at Sharif University in the Spring of 2023.

Note:
The course is instructed in Persian (Farsi) language.
